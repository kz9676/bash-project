I need a tool to automate creation and maintenance of source code modules.
Invoked from command line, such tool would produce a source code module.
Produced source code module would contain a fixed set of empty boilerplate
files. The boilerplate files would describe the source code module and define
its format and structure. Example boilerplate files could be - README, INSTALL,
CHANGELOG, VERSION, etc.
