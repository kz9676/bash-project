I needed a tool to automate creation and maintenance of Bash source code 
modules. Invoked from command line, such tool had to produce a fixed number
of templated files that would form a skeleton of my Bash project. 

From the high level, I envisioned my source modules had to resemble the
following file structure:

.
|-- ./README
|-- ./VERSION
|-- ./AUTHORS
|-- ./CHANGELOG
|-- ./TASKS
|-- ./DEFECTS
|-- ./BUILD
|-- ./INSTALL
|-- ./LICENSES
|-- ./sourcefile.X
|-- ./sourcefile.Y
|-- ./sourcefile.Z
|-- ./library.name.X
|-- ./library.name.Y
|-- ./library.name.Z
|-- ./settings.feature.X
|-- ./settings.feature.Y
|-- ./settings.feature.Z
\-- etc.
