I needed a tool to automate creation and maintenance of source code modules.
Invoked from command line, such tool had to produce a source code module.
Produced source code module would have to contain a fixed set of templated
descriptor files. These templated and automatically generated descriptor files
would define format and structure of the source code module.

From a high level view, I envisioned my source modules to resemble something
similar to the following file structure:

.
|-- ./README
|-- ./VERSION
|-- ./AUTHORS
|-- ./CHANGELOG
|-- ./TASKS
|-- ./DEFECTS
|-- ./BUILD
|-- ./INSTALL
|-- ./LICENSES
|-- ./sourcefile.X
|-- ./sourcefile.Y
|-- ./sourcefile.Z
|-- ./library.name.X
|-- ./library.name.Y
|-- ./library.name.Z
|-- ./settings.feature.X
|-- ./settings.feature.Y
|-- ./settings.feature.Z
\-- etc.
