I needed a tool to automate creation and maintenance of source code modules.
Invoked from command line, such tool had to produce a source code module.
Produced source code module had to contain a fixed set of templated descriptor
files. These templated and automatically generated descriptor files would
define format and structure of the source code module.

From a high level view, my source module had to have the following file
structure:

.
|
+--- ./DESCRIPTION
|
+--- ./VERSION
|
+--- ./AUTHORS
|
+--- ./CHANGELOG
|
+--- ./TASKS
|
+--- ./DEFECTS
|
+--- ./BUILD
|
+--- ./INSTALL
|
+--- ./LICENSES
|
+--- ./.settings
|
+--- etc.
