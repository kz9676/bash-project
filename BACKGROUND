I need a tool that would automate creation and management of source code modules. Invoking such tool from command line would produce a source code module. Such source code module would contain a fixed set of empty boilerplate files. The boilerplate files would describe the source code module and define its format and structure. Example boilerplate files could be - README, INSTALL, CHANGELOG, VERSION, etc.
