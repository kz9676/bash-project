# NOTE - Source module parent directory name must match the source module's
#        settings file name extension (see ./settings.${PWD##*/}). As an 
#        example, source module named 'calmod' must have its parent directory
#        named 'calmod' (eg. /home/userxyz/builds/calmod). Correspondingly,
#        the very same source module's settings file must be accordingly
#        named 'settings.calmod' (eg. ~/builds/calmod/settings.calmod)
