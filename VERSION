Command-line utility for automated creation and maintenance of Bash source code
projects.



Kostya Zolotarov <kostya.zolotarov@globalrelay.net>



I needed a tool to automate creation and maintenance of source code modules.
Invoked from command line, such tool had to produce a source code module.
Produced source code module would have to contain a fixed set of templated
descriptor files. These templated and automatically generated descriptor files
would define format and structure of the source code module.

From a high level view, I envisioned my source modules to resemble something
similar to the following file structure:

.
|-- ./README
|-- ./VERSION
|-- ./AUTHORS
|-- ./CHANGELOG
|-- ./TASKS
|-- ./DEFECTS
|-- ./BUILD
|-- ./INSTALL
|-- ./LICENSES
|-- ./sourcefile.X
|-- ./sourcefile.Y
|-- ./sourcefile.Z
|-- ./library.name.X
|-- ./library.name.Y
|-- ./library.name.Z
|-- ./settings.feature.X
|-- ./settings.feature.Y
|-- ./settings.feature.Z
\-- etc.



    * setup - Setup new source module 
    * build - Build the source module 
    * readme - Build/update the source module README file 
    * files - Build/update the source module FILES file 
    * tasks - Build/update the source module TASKS file 
    * authors - Build/update list of the source module contributors
    * changelog - Build/update the source module CHANGELOG file 
    * version - Increment the source module version inside VERSION file 
    * install - Install the source module 
    * uninstall - Uninstall the source module 



The 'project' consists of two key parts:

    * Application files 
    * Source files

1. Application Files

The application files make up collection of tools to manage a given source
project. Such tools currently include:

    * ./authors 
    * ./build 
    * ./changelog 
    * ./files 
    * ./install 
    * ./package 
    * ./readme 
    * ./setup 
    * ./tasks 
    * ./project 
    * ./uninstall 

2. Source files

The source project files consist of everything that belongs to a given source
project. In the current release, definition of a source project includes:

    * Documents 
    * Templates 
    * Executables 
    * Libraries 
    * Functions 
    * Variables 
    * Options 
    * Configurations 
    * Tests

In closer detail, elements of a source project include the following:

    * Documents 

        * ./API 
        * ./AUTHORS 
        * ./BACKGROUND 
        * ./BUILD 
        * ./CHANGELOG 
        * ./DEFECTS 
        * ./DEPENDENCIES 
        * ./DESCRIPTION 
        * ./DESIGN
        * ./EXAMPLES
        * ./FEATURES 
        * ./INSTALL 
        * ./LICENSE
        * ./README 
        * ./REQUIREMENTS 
        * ./SOURCES 
        * ./TASKS 
        * ./TEST 
        * ./VERSION 

    * Templates

        * ./template.bash.executable 
        * ./template.bash.variable 
        * ./template.bash.function 
        * ./template.bash.test 
        * ./template.bash.configuration 
        * ./template.gitignore 

    * Variables

        * ./variable.[name]
        * ./variable.[name]
        * etc. 

    * Functions

        * ./function.[name]
        * ./function.[name]
        * etc. 

    * Options

        * ./option.[name]
        * ./option.[name]

    * Tests

        * ./test.[name]
        * ./test.[name]
        * etc. 

    * Configurations

        * ./configuration.[name]
        * ./configuration.[name]
        * etc. 



Source code can be obtained on GitHub (https://github.com/kz9676/srcmod).

Presently, I have one active branch:

    * origin/development  - is the main branch where the source code of HEAD
                            always reflects a state with the latest delivered
                            development changes for the next release



The following command gets bash-project installed in a local host environment:

    $ ./install
