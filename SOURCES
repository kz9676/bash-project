Source code can be obtained on GitHub (https://github.com/kz9676/srcmod).
Presently, I have one active branch:

    * origin/development  - is the main branch where the source code of HEAD
                            always reflects a state with the latest delivered
                            development changes for the next release

I often use supporting branches to aid parallel development, tracking of
features, preparation for production release and quick fixes for live
production defects. Supporting branches may include the following:

    * Feature branches
    * Release branches
    * Hotfix branches
