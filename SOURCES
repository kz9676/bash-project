Source code can be obtained on GitHub (https://github.com/kz9676/srcmod). I
follow the Gitflow branching model. Under this model, I have two active
branches - master and develop:

    * origin/master     - is the main branch where the source code of HEAD
                          always reflects a production-ready state.
    * origin/develop    - is the main branch where the source code of HEAD
                          always reflects a state with the latest delivered
                          development changes for the next release

Next to main branches "master" and "develop", we use supporting branches to aid
parallel development, tracking of features, preparation for production release
and quick fixes for live production defects. Supporting branches include the
following:

    * Feature branches
    * Release branches
    * Hotfix branches
